# BTCPayServer App

A Flutter project to build an app for Android (iOS never tested)

## Getting Started

Login into your BTCPayServer

Create a new ApiKey on your Account > Manage Account > ApiKey

Set the following permissions to the ApiKey:
- btcpay.store.canviewinvoices
- btcpay.store.canmodifystoresettings
- btcpay.store.canviewstoresettings
- btcpay.user.canviewprofile

The app allows you to:
- handle stores and apps
- create new invoice for the store selected
- check all your invoices for the store selected

This is my first flutter experience so the code is dirty of course, there are lot of bugs and improvements to do for sure.
Feel free to help me!
